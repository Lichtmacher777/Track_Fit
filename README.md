In this assignment, you will be Alex/Alexa a senior dev \
Once upon a time, in a high-tech company called TechCo, there was a senior developer named Alex/Alexa. Alex/Alexa was known for their exceptional debugging skills and ability to fix even the most perplexing issues in software code. One day, a bright and enthusiastic intern named Lisa joined the team and was assigned to work alongside Alex/Alexa.

Lisa was eager to prove herself and quickly got to work on a new project, developing an innovative mobile app called "TrackFit." The app aimed to help users track their fitness activities and provide personalized workout plans. Lisa divided the app's functionality into five different modules, each requiring separate code files.

Excitedly, Lisa completed coding the five modules but soon realized that her code contained several bugs and errors. Feeling overwhelmed, Lisa approached Alex/Alexa, seeking guidance and assistance in debugging the code. Alex/Alexa agreed to help and asked Lisa to share the five code files with them.

## Task 1: 
In `auth.py` to make the code more efficient she wanted to add a recursive function that asks again for a username and password if the credentials are wrong
## Tesk 2: 
In `workout.py` Lisa only considers that the user is only doing 5 activities. Help her to make the number of activities is user's choice
## Task 3:
In `calories.py` Lisa forgot something in her code that Alex/Alexa will help her to check. Moreover, the number of calories is for every 60 mins. Help her to fix the code and if there are any errors
## Task 4:
In `progress.py` Test the function `update_progress()` to see if everything is good or not and add additional features if needed
## Task 5: 
In `log.py` Lisa couldn't identify the error so Alex/Alexa will help her solve the problem.
## Task 6:
Alex/Alexa will help Lisa to run the main code in `main.py` where it is supposed to validate the user. If the user is valid the program should create a workout plan, progress based on the workout plan, and calories burned, and write them in a file if the user is not valid then the code will use recursion to redo the process.

## Hint :
- In the markdown file, Alex/Alex will add the modifications note so Lisa can understand what you made
- Make sure you include comments on the codes
